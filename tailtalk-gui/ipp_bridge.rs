/// A super hacky IPP bridge that exposes LaserWriter printers on the local network via
/// mDNS/Bonjour and accepts IPP print jobs from macOS/iOS. I built this around making my
/// LaserWriter 4/600 PS accessible via my Mac, and iOS devices for printing. Pretty sure
/// it should work on other systems as it exposes a standard IPP interface and uses PostScript
/// queries to figure out printer capabilities, but I haven't tested beyond the single one I have.
///
/// The other part of this I found is that modern prints tend to generate _enormous_ PostScript files,
/// and these are both slow to send to the printer and take significant time ot process (on the order of 5-10 minutes).
/// With this we now pre-rasterize the PostScript to a smaller PostScript file (with rasterized pages) before sending
/// to the printer, which is much faster - it typically starts printing as soon as the job is fully sent.
/// The rasterization is done via Ghostscript, which must be installed on the system for this to work.
